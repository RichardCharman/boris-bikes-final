As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike works

bike                    can be released
                        working order

docking station         release bike

bike <-- works? -->  true/false
docking station <-- release bike --> a bike

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.
